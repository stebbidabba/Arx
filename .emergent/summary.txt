The previous AI engineer demonstrated an iterative and detail-oriented approach, heavily focused on the React frontend of the ArxDigital landing page. The work involved continuously refining the user interface based on specific aesthetic demands, including advanced CSS for gradients, glass-morphism, and custom animations, as well as integrating and troubleshooting Spline 3D elements. Key sections like Hero, About Us, and Projects were designed to embody a software nerd vibe, often incorporating Icelandic translations. The engineer adeptly handled user feedback, performing numerous modifications and reversions. The work culminated in a sophisticated, animated hexagonal logo design. Most recently, the engineer updated team member phone numbers in the About Us section and subsequently conducted a successful deployment readiness health check.

The primary goal is to develop a conversion-optimized landing page for ArxDigital, a software development firm. The page must embody a sophisticated, layered design with glass-morphism and strong visual impact, aiming for an agency-quality aesthetic. The color palette centers on purple (#9c54f3) and dark blue (#060820), featuring extensive animations. Key sections include Hero, About Us (Um Okkur), and Projects (Okkar Verkefni). Specific design mandates evolved iteratively: a single continuous gradient background across the entire page, elimination of all section dividers, and a simplified, non-fixed header showcasing only the ArxDigital logo. The Hero section requires dynamic 3D Spline animations as a background, with refinements for scrollability, watermark concealment, and software vibe text styling (e.g., animated gradient text, terminal elements, Icelandic translations). The About Us section progressed to detailed (fake) team information with software nerd vibe styling, requiring equal height cards, specific hover effects (spotlight on image, text unchanged), and name updates. Phone numbers for Róbert Spanó (+354 787 7887), Sebastian Fläterud (+354 662 6166), and Arnaldur Nói (+354 777 0731) were explicitly updated. The Projects section should display two enlarged, spaced client logos (Verki, Kaggi), with improved contrast and a unique software vibe animation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **React**: Core frontend library.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
-   **Framer Motion**: Animation library for React.
-   **Spline 3D**: Web-based 3D design tool integrated via iframes.
-   **CSS Animations**: Custom keyframe animations for dynamic effects.
-   **Glassmorphism**: UI design trend for frosted glass effects.
-   **FastAPI**: Backend framework.

<code_architecture>
The application utilizes a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The focus of the trajectory has been entirely on the frontend.



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point. Renders the main layout, including , , , , and sets up .
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to remove the  and  components, directly rendering other sections. Handles the continuous gradient background.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Global CSS styles. Defines base styles, responsive adjustments, and critical styling for backgrounds and animations.
    -   **Changes**: Removed default , implemented  background, added styles for Spline watermark overlay, and included custom CSS animations for text effects in  section.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Header.jsx**:
    -   **Importance**: Header component. Displays the ArxDigital logo.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored to only display the logo centrally, removed navigation, reduced height/padding, and removed  positioning. Underwent several iterations to enhance logo contrast and add software vibe animations, including a final state featuring a hexagon shape, rotating rings, and corner accents for the logo, with orbiting particles removed in the last edit.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Hero.jsx**:
    -   **Importance**: The main hero section. Features the main message, tagline, and interactive elements.
    -   **Changes**: Integrated various Spline 3D iframes. Layout adjusted to two columns. Added a timestamp query parameter to the iframe  for cache-busting. Modified  to  on the Spline iframe to enable scrolling. Incorporated extensive software vibe styling for text, including animated gradient text, terminal-style boxes, and tech badges, with Icelandic translations.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/About.jsx**:
    -   **Importance**: The About Us section. Displays information about the team.
    -   **Changes**: Refactored from card layouts to display three outline images. Later, reintroduced detailed (fake) team member information with a software nerd vibe (glassmorphism cards, hover animations, specific text styling). Edited to ensure all cards had equal height. Underwent multiple elaborate design attempts, which were then reverted to a cleaner look with subtle hover effects. Names were updated to Róbert Spanó, Sebastian Fläterud, and Arnaldur Nói. **Most recently, phone numbers were updated to Róbert Spanó: +354 787 7887, Sebastian Fläterud: +354 662 6166, and Arnaldur Nói: +354 777 0731.**
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/Projects.jsx**:
    -   **Importance**: Showcases client projects. Highlights client logos.
    -   **Changes**: Changed to display only two enlarged client logos (Verki, Kaggi) with increased spacing. Implemented and then reverted complex software vibe and holographic designs. Finally reverted to a simpler display of just the logos. Implemented Icelandic translations for tech badges. An attempt to embed a Figma iframe failed and was reverted.
-   **/app/frontend/src/mock.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Mock data. Provides placeholder data for frontend development.
    -   **Changes**: No direct edits were shown in the trajectory, but its existence is crucial for mock data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer completed two main tasks. Firstly, the engineer refined the aesthetic of the application's header logo, specifically applying a software vibe design to meet user requests for a more original and cool approach to logo visibility and appeal. This involved implementing a hexagon shape for the logo container, rotating rings, corner accents, a white background for high contrast, glassmorphism effects, and a pulsing background. The user then explicitly requested the removal of two small orbiting particles, which was successfully executed. The engineer confirmed in Icelandic the completion of these changes, emphasizing the clean design with the hexagon form, rotating rings, corner accents, and white background, noting the absence of orbiting particles.

Following this, the user provided a new request to update phone numbers for the team members in the About Us section. The engineer successfully read  and updated the phone numbers for Róbert Spanó to +354 787 7887, Sebastian Fläterud to +354 662 6166, and Arnaldur Nói to +354 777 0731. The engineer confirmed the successful update and noted that the changes should be immediately visible due to frontend hot reload.

Finally, the user requested a deployment health check. This was performed by a Deployer Agent, which reported a ✅ PASS - Ready for Deployment status, confirming proper configuration of environment variables, database, CORS, and no identified blockers. The report specifically mentioned that the recent phone number updates seem safe for deployment and asked if further assistance was needed before deployment.

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user if they would like to preview the application or have any additional requests before deployment.
